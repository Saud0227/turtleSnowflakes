# turtleSnowflakes
I made some python snowflakes as basic python examples

This project was made for ppl at my school who wanted basic turtle code examples
if you're using the linux crome os bs and you get the error of tk/tkinter not working, past this into the terminal and respond with y when promted
  
  sudo apt-get install python3-tk
  
  (this basicly dowloads the python module tkinter also known as tk, it's used by python to open seperate windows and draw things on said window, so 
  kinda usfull when we wanna draw shit on windows using tkinter, the error you got previously was turtle complaining about not being able to use tkinter 
  to open windows)
